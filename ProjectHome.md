**python-graph** is a library for working with graphs in Python.

This software provides ï»¿a suitable data structure for representing graphs and a whole set of important algorithms.

The code is appropriately documented and API reference is generated automatically by [epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/).

Comments, bug reports and suggestions are welcome.


---

**Current release:** 1.8.2 - Jul 14, 2012

Please check our [Changelog](Changelog.md) for detailed information.

---

**Installing**

If you have `easy_install` on your system, you can simply run:

|`# easy_install python-graph-core`|
|:---------------------------------|

And, optionally, for Dot-Language support:

|`# easy_install python-graph-dot`|
|:--------------------------------|

Otherwise, you can download a package from the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/downloads/list) page.

**Dependencies**: The Core module requires Python 2.6 or 3.x. Dot-Language support requires Python 2.6, `pydot` and `pyparsing`.
